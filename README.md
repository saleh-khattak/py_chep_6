# Conditional Expressions in Python

This repository contains mini projects that demonstrate the use of **conditional expressions** in Python. Each file showcases practical applications of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to solve real-world problems.

## üìò Topics Covered
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Boolean expressions
- Basic user input and output
- Control flow in decision-making

## üìÅ Projects
