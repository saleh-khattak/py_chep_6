# Conditional Expressions in Python

This repository contains mini projects that demonstrate the use of **conditional expressions** in Python. Each file showcases practical applications of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to solve real-world problems.

## üìò Topics Covered
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Boolean expressions
- Basic user input and output
- Control flow in decision-making

## üìÅ Projects

| File Name             | Description                                    
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------
| `find-greatest.py`   | Finds the greatest number among given inputs.  
| `find_name_list.py`  | Checks if a given name exists in a list.       
| `grade_calculator.py`| Calculates grade based on marks.               
| `pass-fail.py`       | Determines pass or fail based on a score.      
| `spim_filter.py`     | Filters spam based on certain keywords.        

## ‚úÖ Learning Outcome

By completing these projects, you will:
- Understand how conditional expressions work.
- Improve your decision-making logic in code.
- Practice problem-solving with real-world scenarios.

# Python Loop Projects ‚Äì 7th Chapter

## Overview

Today, I explored and practiced **loops in Python**, covering all major loop concepts including:

- `for` loops  
- `while` loops  
- Nested loops  
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)

To reinforce these concepts, I built a series of mini projects and practice exercises. Each script demonstrates specific uses of loops in real-world or educational scenarios.
